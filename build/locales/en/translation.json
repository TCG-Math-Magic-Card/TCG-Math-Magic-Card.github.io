Well-known TCG games include Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc.",

    "算子卡": "Operator Card",
    "算子这个概念可能在你的生活中并不常见，但是你一定知道+这个符号。它一般也被叫做加法符号，我们这里说的算子卡就是类型与+、-之类你常见的技术符号。你可能也感觉到了，算子卡表示的符号可以把两个‘值’（游戏里对应值卡）链接在一起，从而形成一个新的式子。比如：1+1,4-3之类的。": "you certainly know the symbol +. It is generally called the addition symbol. The operator cards we are referring to here are similar to technical symbols that you commonly encounter, such as + and -. As you may have noticed, operator cards represent symbols that can link two 'values' (corresponding to value cards in the game) together to form a new expression, such as 1+1, 4-3, and so on.",
    "算子由蓝色代表": "The operator is represented by blue."
