    "Q: 什么是TCG?": "Q: What is TGC?",
    "A: TCG 是 Trading Card Game 的缩写，翻译为“交换卡牌游戏”。这类游戏通常是指玩家使用自己的卡片组合来与其他玩家对抗。每个卡片代表着不同的角色、能力或装备等，可以通过购买卡片包或者与其他玩家交换来获取更多的卡片，从而丰富自己的卡片库并提高在游戏中的实力。知名的 TCG 游戏包括《魔法飞球》（Magic: The Gathering）、《炉石传说》（Hearthstone）、《游戏王》（Yu-Gi-Oh!）等。": "A: TCG stands for Trading Card Game, which refers to a type of game where players use their own card combinations to compete against other players. Each card represents different characters, abilities, or equipment, and can be obtained by purchasing card packs or trading with other players to enrich their card collections and improve their strength in the game. Well-known TCG games include Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc.",
    "Q: 数学魔法卡是一个什么样的游戏？": "Q: What kind of game is Math Magic Card?",
    "A: 数学魔法卡，是一个致力于将纯粹的数学概念融入到桌游中的游戏。当然里面会有魔法的部分，但是我保证核心获胜的机制是数学概念。": "A: Math Magic Card is a game dedicated to integrating pure mathematical concepts into tabletop games. Of course, there will be magical elements, but I guarantee that the core winning mechanism is based on mathematical concepts.",
    "Q: 为什么要设计这样的游戏？": "Q: Why design such a game?",
    "A: 单纯出于好玩。": "A: Just For Fun!",

    "简易规则": "Simple Rule",
    "值卡": "Value Card",
    "值卡表示最纯粹的值。比如数字1或者数字2。它们的意义和你平时理解的数学上的1和2是差不多的。只是以卡片的形式体现。": "Value cards represent the purest form of value, such as the number 1 or the number 2. Their meaning is similar to what you would understand as mathematical 1 and 2 in everyday life, just expressed in the form of cards.",
    "右侧的图片就是一张值卡": "The picture on the right is a value card.",
    "【最初的数字 1】是卡片的名字": "[Junior Number One] is the name of the card",
    "黑板（也就是公式区）中的白字是它的值。": "The white text in the blackboard (also known as formula area) is its value.",
    "下方的描述是效果，在简易规则里你可以忽略这些。": "The description below is the effect. You can ignore these in the simple rule. ",
    "圆圈中的黄色代表了这张卡是值卡。请习惯利用颜色分辨卡的功能。": "The yellow color in the circle represents that this card is a value card. Please get used to distinguishing the function of cards by their colors.",
    "算子卡": "Operator Card",
    "算子这个概念可能在你的生活中并不常见，但是你一定知道+这个符号。它一般也被叫做加法符号，我们这里说的算子卡就是类型与+、-之类你常见的技术符号。你可能也感觉到了，算子卡表示的符号可以把两个‘值’（游戏里对应值卡）链接在一起，从而形成一个新的式子。比如：1+1,4-3之类的。": "you certainly know the symbol +. It is generally called the addition symbol. The operator cards we are referring to here are similar to technical symbols that you commonly encounter, such as + and -. As you may have noticed, operator cards represent symbols that can link two 'values' (corresponding to value cards in the game) together to form a new expression, such as 1+1, 4-3, and so on.",
    "算子由蓝色代表": "The operator is represented by blue.",
    "断言卡": "Assertion Card",
    "断言卡上有一句断言，用来描述一个数学概念。比如“这是偶数”、“这是奇数”。通过值卡和算子卡构成的式子我们可以得出一个值。然后我们通过我们的数学知识就可以知道这个断言的真假了。比如 1+1 | 是奇数，1+1 | 是偶数。我们可以知道第一个组合是假，第二个组合是真。": "An Assertion card contains a statement describing a mathematical concept, such as \"this is an even number\". We can obtain a value through an expression formed by Value cards and Operator cards, and then use our mathematical knowledge to determine the truth or falsehood of the assertion.",
    "断言由红色代表": "The assertion is represented by red",
    "VP表示胜利点数，DP表示失败点数": "VP represents victory points, and DP represents defeat points.",

    "不大于7张。在每个回合结束前要弃置至7张。": "No more than 7. Discard up to 7 cards before the end of each round.",
    "游戏场地": "playground",
    "现在想象在你和对手之间有一些格子。总共有五个，正好可以放置5张卡片。奇数的位置处专门摆放值卡，偶数的位置处专门摆放算子卡。我们给这五个格子取个名字：“泳道”。奇数位叫做“值区”，偶数位叫做“算子区”。然后随便找个离自己近的位置。取名叫做“断言区”，你可能已经感觉出来了，这里是专门摆放断言卡的。不同的是：值区和算子区只能放着一张卡，断言区可以放许多张。你和对手各有一个断言区。": "Now imagine there are some spaces between you and your opponent. There are a total of five, which is just enough to place five cards. Odd-numbered places are for value cards, and even-numbered ones are for operator cards. Let's name these five spaces \"lanes\". The odd-numbered lane is called the \"value area\", and the even-numbered lane is called the \"operator area\". Then find a nearby location and name it the \"assertion area.\" You may have already guessed that this is where assertion cards are specifically placed. The difference is that only one card can be placed on the value and operator areas, while many cards can be placed on the assertion area. You and your opponent each have an assertion area.",

    "在摸牌过后可以选择下来的两项中的一项进行，或者什么也不做之间进行下一个阶段。": "After drawing two cards, you can choose to proceed with one of the two options, or do nothing and move on to the next phase.",
    "设置值": "Set Value",
    "选择一个还没有使用的【值区】，从手牌正面朝上放置一个值卡。": "Choose an unused [Value Area] and place a value card from your hand face up on it.",
    "设置算子": "Set Operator",
    "选择一个还没有使用的【算子区】，从手牌正面朝上放置一个算子卡。": "Choose an unused [Operator Area] and place an operator card from your hand face up on it.",
    "case_art_pic": "pic/case_art_en.jpg",
    "你可以从手卡选择一个断言卡放置在断言区内。": "You can choose a Assertion card from your hand and place it in the [Assertion Area].",
    "那么如何判断游戏结束和哪方获胜呢？每次回合结束的时候你们要看泳道内的5个区域是否都被摆满了卡。如果泳道内的卡满了。那么就就终止游戏，开始判断输赢了。": "So how do you determine when the game ends and who wins? At the end of each turn, you need to check whether all five areas in the lanes are filled with cards. If the lanes are full, the game ends, and it's time to determine the winner.",
    "正如上面所述的一样。你要计算出泳道内值和算子构成的值。然后每个玩家再用这个值和自己断言区内的每个断言卡进行组合，断言为真胜利点数加上VP,断言为假胜利点数减去DP。然后比较两个那个胜利点数大，大的一方获得胜利。": "As mentioned above, you need to calculate the value formed by the values and operators in the lanes. Then each player uses this value and combines it with each assertion card in their own assertion area. If an assertion is true, victory points are added (VP), and if an assertion is false, victory points are subtracted (DP). Then compare which player has more victory points, and the player with more points wins.",
    "听起来很简单是不是？在游戏中你要预测泳道可能出现的值，并且规划好设置断言的策略，如果设置的太多可能反而让自己失败。": "It sounds simple, doesn't it? In the game, you need to predict possible values in the lanes and plan your assertion strategy carefully. Setting too many assertions may actually lead to failure.",
    "测试一下!": "Test now!",
    "谁赢了？": "Who Wins?",
    "上方": "Total",
    "下方": "Bottom",
    "恭喜你答对了！": "Brillent!",
    "很遗憾.下方获胜了。泳道的值为1+1+1=3。是奇数。下方偶数断言卡一张。总胜利点数-1而上面有两张胜利点数-2。(-1>-2)": "Sorry, the bottom player wins this round. The value of the lanes is 1+1+1=3, which is an odd number. The bottom player has one even proposition card. Therefore, the total victory points -1, but the top player has two 'even' cards that are worth -2 each, which means (-1 > -2).",
