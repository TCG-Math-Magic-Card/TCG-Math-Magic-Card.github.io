I don't need anything particularly complex. I just need your enthusiasm and participation. You can:
- Help design a logo, there is currently no good-looking logo.
- Help design card illustrations or artwork.
- Help design cards. I know there are still many, many cards needed.
- Help optimize the rules. I have optimized some of the rules myself, but I know they are not enough.
- Help test the cards that have already been released.
- Help with translation. I hope there will also be a Japanese version!
- Help with promotion.
- Just play it and give feedback on your experience.
